// =============================================================================
// The store's own BIP47 identity, and the signature it puts on every address it
// issues.
//
// WHAT THE SIGNATURE IS FOR, precisely, because claiming more than this would
// be worse than claiming nothing. It binds an address to the store's payment
// code, which a customer already knows from data/store.json and can check
// against the store's PayNym. That defeats a compromised WEB SERVER swapping in
// an attacker's address, because the web server has no key.
//
// It does NOT defend against a compromised GATEWAY, which by construction holds
// the key that makes signatures. An attacker who owns this process can sign
// their own address and the customer's check will pass. The defence against
// that case is pool.mjs, where the addresses are derived and signed offline by
// the operator's personal wallet and this process never holds a key at all.
//
// The key here cannot spend. An attacker who steals the seed learns every
// address the store will ever issue — a real and permanent privacy breach — but
// cannot move a satoshi, because spending needs the personal wallet's key. That
// asymmetry is why this service can exist at all.
