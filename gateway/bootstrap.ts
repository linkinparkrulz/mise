// First run: the shop makes itself an identity, on every network it can trade on.
//
// This is the "store PayNym bot". It is one half of a BIP47 pair; the other
// half is the operator's PERSONAL payment code. Every address a customer is
// asked to pay is derived from the two together, with the bot as sender and the
// operator's own wallet as receiver, which is why the server can say where a
// payment should go and still not be able to touch it when it arrives.
//
// The seed lives here and only here. The gateway is the one process that holds
// a key; the web-facing backend reaches these values over the unix socket
// rather than reading the file, so a compromised front end has nothing to read.
//
// ONE SEED, BOTH NETWORKS. The same twelve words derive a distinct identity per
// network — different payment code, different notification address — so both
// are created at setup and the operator switches between them. One backup
// covers both, and testnet4 is a real chain to rehearse the notification
// transaction on before mainnet money is involved.
//
// The test chain is testnet4. It shares testnet3's address version bytes, bech32
// HRP and coin type, so derivation is identical between them and the library
// needs no testnet4 entry — see LIB_NETWORK in derive.ts, the one place the two
// vocabularies meet. The records say testnet4 anyway, because that sameness is
// the hazard: an address is valid on both testnets and the coins are not, so
// nothing but the record itself says which chain a payment was quoted for.
//
// regtest is absent as a block. Its notification addresses match testnet's (same
// p2pkh version byte), but its invoice addresses do NOT: regtest's bech32 HRP is
// bcrt, testnet's is tb, and invoice addresses have been segwit since ea6e193.
// So a regtest deployment is its own chain in practice; it is left out rather
// than pretended to be testnet4 with different-looking addresses.
//
// The bot does hold a little money, once per network. Before a stock wallet will
// recognise the pair, the SENDER has to announce it in an on-chain notification
// transaction: it spends an input of its own and pays an output to the
// RECEIVER's notification address. That costs a fee, so the bot needs an
// ordinary chain it can spend from — its deposit address, see deposit.ts. The
// operator funds that, the bot spends it once to make the announcement, and it
// never needs funding again.
//
// Not its own notification address, which is a different role: that is where
// somebody else would announce a pair TO this bot, and where a customer checks
// the signature on an address the shop quoted. The bot holds that key too, so
// funding it there would work, which is precisely why the two are worth keeping
// apart in writing.
